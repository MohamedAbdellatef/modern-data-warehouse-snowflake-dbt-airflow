# Business Layer

This folder captures business intent before technical modeling.

## Structure
- `business_processes/` — narratives like Order-to-Cash, Customer Activity, Store Target vs Actual.
- `qnf/` — QNF (Questions & Facts) library mapped to KPIs.
- `bus_matrix.md` — Fact tables × Dimensions coverage for conformed modeling.

## Flow
1) Business process → 2) QNFs/KPIs → 3) Grain cards (see `03_design/`) → 4) Stars.
